Now that I've passed the fifth and final project assessment, it has been difficult not to be in a reflective mode. Specifically, questions concerning fundamental changes in programming principles I've chosen to adopt as well as my basic temperament when programming have been the most pressing. When I first entered the bootcamp, I presumed my success would hinge on following a strict and pragmatic methodology, progressing through convention and blueprint execution. While some stretches were attuned nicely to this standard, the more difficult tasks that would arise, particularly when building projects from scratch, were not. In fact, when I'd hit walls in these scenarios, regression weighed more heavily than when I was successful. Additionally, I was significantly harder on myself and immensely discouraged. I felt more inclined to abandon my work than return to it. When deciding to change my approach, I wanted to immerse myself in a flow where success emerged naturally rather than having every step of the way marked prior to the actual work and then rigidly following it. The key here was to lower my expectations for a block of work. This way I could increase my comfort level and approach the work like a playground. With the fundamental concepts at my disposal, I can try things, adjust perspectives, stop and then resume smoothly. The requirements I necessitated for myself were altogether removed from the hierarchy of importance. I became more excited about learning through the work than about the affirmation of a finished project that had all of its machinations plainly listed beforehand.
