     The decision to learn programming was one that sort of avalanched into reality not long after the prospect entered my brain. I've spent most of the free time throughout my life reading and writing. The incessant deliberation encompassing both of these activites doubles as a gravitational pull I'm too willing to submit to. It seems I find a general peace in being uncomfortable or uncertain and reveling in lines of thought I'm too familiar with. It's gratifying to be both baffled and encouraged you're onto something; I'm not toeing some thread toward a particular end. I think I do these things because it feels I'm here and there, constantly moving, when I'm really in a room lost in my thoughts. 
		 Programming is finding a seat next to these joys because I envision a future where I can bring these elements together and make something that's technical, yes, but leaves me perturbed and curious to embark on another endeavor like it. When I'm writing a beginner's program, I'm trying to approach it from all angles and understand where I'm at, what a decision will lead to, the unintended results that'll be unveiled and, in spite of all of this, when the finished thing is running in linear motion down my terminal, it escapes succinct summation. It could be the way it makes me feel or the act of rationally retreading your steps which feels like beginning again, I'm not sure. 
		 Video games encapsulate these notions. They're rooted in my childhood, where parameters weren't tangible, pit me in alternative worlds that have their own spirit, sense and logic, and are able to flow the way they do because of technical prowess and methodical effort. I'd really like to make one.
